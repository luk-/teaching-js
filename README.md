#teaching-js

I'd like to start coming up with ideas for lesson plans and projects to use to
teach kids how to write javascript.

It might be easier to think of projects first, then the details necessary to make
a lesson plan for the project (starting of course with some essential basics).

In the wiki there are pages for [Projects](https://github.com/st-luke/teaching-js/wiki/Projects)
and [Lesson Plans](https://github.com/st-luke/teaching-js/wiki/Lesson-Plans).

Feel free to use these for brainstorming stuff, or big/small ideas you think of.

Once there are some ideas for projects and lesson plans, we can break things apart
into the pieces necessary for someone to actually teach the content to a group
and help them work on the project.
